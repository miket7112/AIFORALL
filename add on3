        <h2>Understanding Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on building systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These tasks can range from recognizing speech to making decisions and even playing complex games like chess.</p>

        <p>AI is built on algorithms that allow systems to learn from data, adapt to new situations, and improve their performance over time. One of the most common branches of AI is **machine learning**, where systems are trained on large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions.</p>

        <p>AI is already having a significant impact on many industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. In the coming years, AI technologies are expected to continue revolutionizing how we interact with the world.</p>
